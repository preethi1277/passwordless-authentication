<h2> üß† How It Works  </h2>
1. User enters email/username  <br>
2. System prompts authentication via **biometrics, OTP, or security key**  <br>
3. A signed cryptographic response is sent to the server  <br>
4. Server verifies the signature and grants access  <br>
5. Security logs & monitoring track suspicious activity  <br>
